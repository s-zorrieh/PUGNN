# PUGNN - PU Estimation Using Graph Neural Networks

All classes are defined in `PUGNN.py`. The API is briefly discused in `Hello World Program.ipynb`.


The outputs are available in `test-PUGNN` directory. Clone the Repository to see the output plots whose extensions are `*.html`.

I will add more examples!
